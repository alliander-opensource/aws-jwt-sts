The process for a code change and pull request you should follow:

1. Create a topic branch in your local repository, following the naming format
"feature-[description]". For more information see the Git branching guideline.
1. Make changes, compile, and test thoroughly. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build. Code style should match existing style and conventions, and changes should be focused on the topic the pull request will be addressed. For more information see the style guide.
1. Push commits to your fork.
1. Create a Github pull request from your topic branch.
1. Pull requests will be reviewed by one of the maintainers who may discuss, offer constructive feedback, request changes, or approve
